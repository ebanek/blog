Welcome to my personal blog! I plan to post here about my entrepreneurship journey, lessons that I'm learning, and any topic that grabs my interest.

When programming, my style is to dive deep and work out all possibilities in search of the best solutions. This is often not the fastest, but it does result in many different ideas being explored.

For my work, I'm currently into project management and Monday.com in particular - I like to make things that delight users and save them time and effort. I'm also interested in learning more about biotech, and my current hobbies are sailing and Mandarin Chinese.

Blogs and podcast on business that I follow are:
*   Cedric Chin's [Commoncog](https://commoncog.com/),
*   Rob Walling's [Startups for the Rest of Us](https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/),
*   Jason Cohen's [A Smart Bear](https://longform.asmartbear.com/). 

Many things that I want to say are spin-offs and thoughts on material from the above.

I hope you'll find the blog interesting!
